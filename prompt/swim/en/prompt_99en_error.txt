Runtime error has occurred. 

[stderr]
{STDERR}

Please check the following items and debug the program.

- Were you following the restrictions?

- Don't add/remove server during serverbooting

- Did you include necessary files?

- dimmer value is [0..1]

- Take care of the upper/lower limit of servers.

- It is possible to add/remove a server and change the dimmer setting simultaneously. But, do not create a situation where MacroTactic returns operations on increasing or decreasing the number of servers at the same time, i.e., MacroTactics = [RemoveServerTactic(), AddServerTactic()], [RemoveServerTactic(), RemoveServerTactic()], [AddServerTactic(), AddServerTactic()] by managing varibables "Serverflag".


This is the code that caused the error.
