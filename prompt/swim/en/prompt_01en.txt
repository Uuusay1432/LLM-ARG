The revenue is higher when more optional content is served and the response time requirement is met in the Web Servers.
Not including the optional content in the response to request reduces the load imposed on the system.
Moreover, the load imposed on the system is reduced by increasing the number of servers, but the cost of running a system is proportional to the number of servers used.


When we simulate the system in SWIM (Simulator for Web Infrastructure and Management), the AdaptationManager calls evaluate method in defined period by the parameter and it treats these tradeoff.
Whether the optional content are provided or not is determined using the value of dimmer[0..1].
The value of the dimmer can be thought of as the probability of a response including the optional content.
AdaptationManager defines the value of utility in the period calculated by outer utility function and it aims to maximize the sum of utilities over the entire period of the simulation.

A utility function is written in R language and that is following.

periodUtilityICAC2016 <- function(maxServers, maxServiceRate, arrivalRateMean, dimmer,
                          evaluationPeriod, RT_THRESHOLD, avgResponseTime,
                          avgServers) {
  basicRevenue <- 1
  optRevenue <- 1.5
  maxThroughput <- maxServers * maxServiceRate
  latePenalty <- maxThroughput * optRevenue
  
  positiveUtility <- round((arrivalRateMean * ((1 - dimmer) * basicRevenue + dimmer * optRevenue)))

  utility <- ifelse(avgResponseTime>RT_THRESHOLD | avgResponseTime < 0,
         pmin(0.0, arrivalRateMean * optRevenue - latePenalty),
         positiveUtility)

}



Operation of changing dimmer value and increasing or decreasing the number of servers are realized by the methods of "pMacroTactic->addTactic()".

Increase the number of Servers:     pMacroTactic->addTactic(new AddServerTactic);
Change the value of dimmer:   		pMacroTactic->addTactic(new SetDimmerTactic(dimmer))
Decrease the number of Servers:     pMacroTactic->addTactic(new RemoveServerTactic)

Evaluate method returns MacroTactic. Tactics including MacroTactic are executed in parallel, so all operations are executed in the same time.


Moreover, the number of Servers and ActiveServers are different because booting servers needs time after adding servers. In this time, it takes 120s to boot a server(latency = 120s).

Based on the above, I will tell you the example of AdaptationManager program.
